[Magic the gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) is both a trading card and digital collectible card game created by Richard Garfield. It has several different playing environments, you can enjoy some great [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOcCTSL7dmw&list=PLE80E6ECBCC4D51B4) of it.  [Aavcyn](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Avacyn) is one of the card in Magic the gathering. I like this character very much, so I made this name as my screen name, I hope I can be like Avacyn in the game, brave, kind, perseverance and being the gurdian of the people my love, even the people in the world. <br />

### Me in reality

![me](/assets/img/posts/ME2.jpg) <br />

**M.Sc.** *Chemical Engineering* <br />
**B.Sc.** *Food Science and safety* <br />

My ambition towards scientific research started from childhood when I always listen to those adults talking about the scientific  development. At that time mother set a good example to me.
She gave up many very good development opportunities for me and my father, so she only has a very small lab with some backward instruments. She taught me spirit of self-sacrifice.
Though she doesn’t have any advanced instrument, she trying hard to do better research. She taught me dedication, responsibility and persistence.
With limited resources, she came up with many brilliant ideas that to use cheap materials and innovative methods to replace the function of those advanced instruments. She taught me how to face to the adversity, being unyielding and truly thrive in the career.
After I became real interested in some specific research area, I hope I can pursuit my academic dream in a good insititution and interpretsat the dream for my mother at the same time.

Now I'm applying a *Ph.D* position in a lab doing research about nano materials and their systhesis,characterization, modification and their application in energy or biology. Besides, I'm very interested in computational material science, and statistics with it's applicaiton in biology or other fields.[Curriculum Vitae](/assets/img/docs/jia-wang-cv.pdf).
