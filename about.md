### Me on the Screen
[Magic the gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) is both a trading card and digital collectible card game created by Richard Garfield. It has several different playing environments, you can enjoy some great [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOcCTSL7dmw&list=PLE80E6ECBCC4D51B4) of it.  [Aavcyn](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Avacyn) is one of the card in Magic the gathering. I like this character very much, so I made this name as my screen name, I hope I can be like Avacyn in the game, brave, kind, perseverance and being the gurdian of the people my love, even the people in the world. <br />
