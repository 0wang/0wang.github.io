##### <font color="#2F4F4F">The Universal Studios Hollywood</font>

- Though I went to The Universal Studios for five times, but I never been there after the Harry Potter Castle opened to public. As a big fan of Harry Potter, who wathced the series of movies more than 10 times  and read the books more than 5 times, THAT'S THE PLACE I MUST GO!
It was amazing, just like the Diagonal Alley in the movies. Buuuuuut,it was really crowded. We waited in line for
the 10 mins magic show for 2 hours!
Butter beer is highly recomended! No alcohol, so young fans friendly. The light show after 9 pm. was the best on that day !

- Las Vegas was the second stop in our trip. Though I lived at Los Angeles where very close to Las Vegas for 3 years, it was the first time I been there. The Wynn is a very worthy hotel to stayed at. We also watched the Mystery show by Cirque du Soleil, great show moving aesthetic. Stage design,clothing and the rhythm of the show was fantasticï¼ŒCirque du Soleil deserves the famous.

- The night view of Las Vegas was amazing, our room at Wynn was just oriented to this view. I took this picture on 56th floor. In order not to take a reflection of the room, I hidden between the window and curtain, then I pressed shutter.

- We also had the famous buffet at Wynn, it was good but the dessert was......a disaster.

- The Arches National Park was the second stop in our trip. We went to the trail to the world famous delicate arch. According to the information, the trail is only 2 miles, we tought it was easy. However, it was a really hard trail, we took rest for 8 times and drank 8 bottles of water.
But, it worth!

- On the road from the Arches national park to Denver, the sceneries was great! Different landscapes and landforms amazed me. I asked one of my friend who is a geography Ph.D about these various "stone" mountains, she tole me the most of them are shale, the different color is caused by different minerals. Though I know these knowledge from my childhood, I can't recognized them, this was the first time I see these by my eyes.
  We drove along the Colorado river for 6 hours!
