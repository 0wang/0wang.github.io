Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) include numerous chemical classes. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) include numerous chemical classes, while personal care products are used to improve the quality of daily life.

PPCPs are recognized as pseudo persistent organic pollutants in the environment.
The risk to the environment as the truly persistent organic pollutants due to their continuous introduction
into the environment by means of different ways. Although the concentrations of PPCPs in the environment are very low as aforementioned, they still can affect water quality and ecosystem balance, and even impact drinking water resources.
They will interfere the endocrine system to produce undesired effects/disruption of homeostasis and lead to potential creation of antibiotic resistant strains in natural bacterial populations.

Extensive use of antibiotics in human medicine and animal husbandry is the major cause of emerging of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which has become a pathogenic bacteria threat. The effective prevention and treatment to various infectious diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant.
For example,water-borne diclofenac at levels of 5–50 μg/L affects kidney and gill integrity and selected immune parameters in the fish as well as the toxicity of ciprofloxacin to green algae where toxicity of oxolinic acid (a commonly used feed additive in fish farms) to Daphnia magna, as well as the toxicity of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.
