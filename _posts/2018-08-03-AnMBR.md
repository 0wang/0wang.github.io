To advance decentralized [anaerobic membrane bioreactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_membrane_bioreactor) (AnMBR) treatment of food waste by evaluating two-phase AnMBR digestion, co-digestion with fats, oil, and grease (FOG), and ceramic membranes in bench- and full-scale studies.

#### Introduction

Anaerobic digestion (AD) process leads to the formation of biogas from various microbial biomass substrates, which gained great importance recently years since biogas (a mixture of carbon dioxide and methane) is a renewable energy source and promising climate change mitigation option [1]. Methane as an alternative clean energy (CH4 has an energy value of 35 kJ L−1 under standard conditions) is a sustainable waste disposal system [2]. AD process also offer other advantages, for example, it requires a low energy input, has a high degree of waste stabilization, lower amount of sludge production in comparison to aerobic waste treatment systems and more thorough destruction of viral and bacterial pathogens [3-4].

Anaerobic biodegradation is known as a fermentation process including four consequent degradation phases, typically hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis
as shown in Fig 1 [5]. The first three steps are performed by bacteria and methanogenesis is performed by a branch of archaea. Fermentative (hydrolysis and acidogenesis) and acetogenic bacteria have been reported to have higher diversity and faster growth rate than methanogens archaea in methane fermentation [6], the fast growing acid formers (Bacteria) and the slow growing methane formers (Archaea) often cause process  instability.  

Food waste is the second largest category of municipal solid waste (MSW) sent to landfills in the United States, accounting for 18% of the waste stream or approximately 35 million tons each year [7]. It's known that the food waste is higly biodegradability that could convert the waste stream to a useful end  product such as energy via anaerobic microbiological conversion to biogas, and the biomass could be continued used as fertilizer. However, produced biogas always can't be collected leading to significant greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere.

Currently, the main technology being used to recycle food waste is composting, which can only get 2.5% of food waste recycled in the U.S. Besides, composting requires energy, big foot print and can have may problems. Thus, an alternative strategy is to implement decentralized anaerobic digestion facilities exclusively for food waste management.

AnMBRs, which combine anaerobic digestion and membrane separation, are an attractive technology for decentralized food waste management.Membrane separation allows AnMBRs to generate a significantly higher quality effluent via biomass retention resulting in an effluent free of suspended solids. In decentralized treatment systems, this higher effluent quality provides cost savings via a lower sewer service charge or quality surcharge fee on industrial wastewater permits. These costs can still be substantial with AnMBR treatment [8].

Comparing to aerobic digestion, AnMBRS shares several advantages:
- High energy recovery
- Less biomass production
- No energy for aeration requirement
- Generate a comparable effluent quality regarding carbon removal

#### Objectives
-  Operate and monitor a bench-scale two-phase (acid-phase and methane-phase) AnMBR for treatment of food waste to improve process resilience during fluctuating feed characteristics. Full-scale evaluation of two-phase AnMBR treatment will be performed pending results from bench-scale investigation.
-  Evaluate co-digestion of food waste and FOG in bench-scale single- and two-phase AnMBR treatment.
-  Compare the performance of polymeric and ceramic membranes for food waste treatment to improve membrane integrity and develop strategies to reduce membrane fouling control energy demands.
-  Perform LCA to quantify economic and environmental opportunities for anaerobic treatment of food waste.

- Constructed and operated two bench-scale AnMBRs for food waste treatment at mesophilic temperatures. The bioreactors will have a liquid volume of 5 L (total volume of 7 L) and will be operated at 35°C via a recirculating water bath.
