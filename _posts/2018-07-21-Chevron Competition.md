#### Abstract
Chevron has assigned a challenged question on the instability occurred in a pressure control system. Based on the control mechanism and the given graphs, detailed investigation - such as quantitative analysis - has been made. The instability was found most likely to be caused by the pressure change in the reflux drum. Two most reliable possibilities that leads to the drum pressure change were raised separately throughout the discussion, which is heavy rain and the agitated reflux drum surface. Based on the analysis throughout the whole project, the conclusion comes out to be a combination of both external and internal factors, which should be the mostly possible case that affects the drum pressure, thus caused the instability.

#### Control Mechanism

When designing a distillation column, pressure is one of the most important variables that needs to be considered for maximizing the purity of products. For a distillation column, pressure involves in each step throughout the system, including vaporization, condensation, and etc. Therefore, control system of pressure is very important in a process design[1]. There are several ways of controlling the tower pressure, such as direct control of vapor product rate; control recycle vapor rate to compressor; control flow from condenser; dual pressure control of bypass and condensate; direct control of liquid product rate; and etc[2]. In this project, the pressure control of a tower with an overhead hot vapor flow has been applied, and only liquid product is expected at the end. In order to increase the purity of the liquid products, and also for safety consideration, as Figure 1 shown, a bypass valve is added between the top of the column and the reflux drum to control the top pressure of the tower, as well as the drum pressure.

##### Hot Vapor Bypass Configuration
Hot Vapor Bypass design consists of total condenser and a reflux drum. The vapor product coming out of the distillation tower top is split into two stream, with one going to the condenser and the other one bypassing the condenser and straight into the drum. The bypass stream flowrate is controlled by a bypass valve that reacts to the change in tower top pressure
###### Partially Flooded-Condenser
The condenser is a shell-and-tubes heat exchanger with vapor entering the shell side and cooling water running inside the tubes. The condenser not only condenses all of the hot vapor inlet but also further cools the condensate below its boiling point. This requires partial flooding of the condenser tube â€“ the tubes above the liquid surface (unflooded region) absorbs all the latent heat of the vapor while the one below take away sensible heat [3]. The degree to which the condenser is flooded is vital to achieving effective control as it directly affect the tower top pressure. As the condenser is flooded, more tubes are immersed, causing rate of condensation to go down and tower pressure to build up. Conversely, when we unflood, more tube area is exposed, increasing condensation and lower tower pressure. Flooding of the condenser is regulated by changing the amount of bypass hot vapor allowed into the reflux drum.
###### Vapor Bypass and Reflux Drum
As mentioned in the last paragraph, the control of the condenser liquid level is crucial to stability of the system. This is achieved by maintaining the appropriate difference between the liquid levels in the condenser and the reflux drum. The height difference between the two liquid levels, or the head, is in turn determined by the pressure difference inside the two vessels. The law that governs the relationship will be discussed in detail in the following sections.
The pressure in the reflux drum is set by the heat balance occurring the vapor-liquid interface. As subcooled liquid coming from the condenser enters the drum from the bottom inlet and hot bypass vapor is injected from the top, an equilibrium is obtained where the two phases meet. The heat is supplied by the hot vapor on top and taken away by the subcooled liquid underneath. There is in fact a thin layer of liquid at its bubble point temperature which sets the vapor pressure for the drum vapor space [4]. This is of great importance in understanding the mechanism of the control design and successfully predicting the behavior of the system.
The drum pressure is controlled by adjusting the bypass valve that monitors the tower top pressure. By increasing the valve opening and allowing more vapor to enter, more heat is brought into the drum which heats up the said thin liquid layer and raises the drum pressure [5]. Conversely, closing the valve reduces in heat input and lowers drum temperature and pressure.
###### Inverse Response
Suppose that the column pressure increased, but since there is a delay to feedback to the condenser, so much more heat flow into the reflux drum. This result in a temporary pressure increasing for the reason that it take times for lowering condenser level. Then, the pressure differences between P1 and P2 shown in Figure 1 and the percentage of opening valve continue increasing for a while. After a period of time, the level of condenser drop to a lower level which means a higher rate of condensation and preventing of continue increasing of tower top. The temporary pressure response is called Inverse Response[6].

#### Instability Case Study
##### Observation of Anomalous Event
As can be seen from Figure 3, around 10:40, a spike in Bypass dP was recorded, rising from 5psi to as high as 12 psi at 10:48 before returning to normal-operation level at 10:55. This was accompanied by sharp increases in both Hot-Vapor-Bypass Valve Opening (from 50% to over 80%) and Reflux Drum Level (from 40% to 80%). A dip in Tower Top Pressure from 291 psig to 288 psig was also observed. Other readings - condenser Outlet Temperature, Reflux Flowrate, Light Cycle Oil Flowrate and C3 Production - remained unchanged throughout the incident.

#### Conclusion Drawn from Data
Since Bypass dP= Tower Top Pressure - Reflux Drum Vapor (neglecting line pressure drop), and the drop in Tower Top Pressure (3psi) only accounted for a small part of the increase in Bypass dP (7psi), we can conclude that there was a drastic decrease in the P2. According to Equation 1 , this would lead to a higher hydraulic head between the condenser and reflux drum, pushing more subcooled liquid into the drum and therefore raising the liquid level. At this point, more tube area in the condenser was exposed due to liquid exiting and as a direct result, the Tower Top Pressure decreased, causing the control mechanism to kick in[8]. Hot-Vapor-Bypass opened, allowing more vapor to enter the reflux drum, restoring drum temperature and thus pressure.

As the previous section has established, the pressure in the reflux drum vapor space is essentially the vapor pressure of the liquid surface, which is determined by the temperature which is in turn calculated based on the energy balance at the interfacial thin liquid film. We speculate that the pressure decrease in the reflux drum- the cause for the disturbance- can most likely be attributed to a sudden drop in the drum temperature.
The fact that the condenser outlet temperature remained unchanged at 65oF suggests that even when the reflux drum level was at its highest, the condenser did not empty completely. Although the submerged tube area had decreased, it still managed to subcool the condensed liquid down to the same temperature. We further deduced that 65oF is in fact the lowest possible temperature for the subcooled liquid - in other words, the temperature of the cooling water.
