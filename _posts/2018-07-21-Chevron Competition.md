#### Abstract
Chevron has assigned a challenged question on the instability occurred in a pressure control system. Based on the control mechanism and the given graphs, detailed investigation - such as quantitative analysis - has been made. The instability was found most likely to be caused by the pressure change in the reflux drum. Two most reliable possibilities that leads to the drum pressure change were raised separately throughout the discussion, which is heavy rain and the agitated reflux drum surface. Based on the analysis throughout the whole project, the conclusion comes out to be a combination of both external and internal factors, which should be the mostly possible case that affects the drum pressure, thus caused the instability.

#### Control Mechanism

When designing a distillation column, pressure is one of the most important variables that needs to be considered for maximizing the purity of products. For a distillation column, pressure involves in each step throughout the system, including vaporization, condensation, and etc. Therefore, control system of pressure is very important in a process design[1]. There are several ways of controlling the tower pressure, such as direct control of vapor product rate; control recycle vapor rate to compressor; control flow from condenser; dual pressure control of bypass and condensate; direct control of liquid product rate; and etc[2]. In this project, the pressure control of a tower with an overhead hot vapor flow has been applied, and only liquid product is expected at the end. In order to increase the purity of the liquid products, and also for safety consideration, as Figure 1 shown, a bypass valve is added between the top of the column and the reflux drum to control the top pressure of the tower, as well as the drum pressure.
