Ginkgo biloba is a kind of plant with high medicinal value. The extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGb) contains up to 28 % of flavonoids and about 6 % of ginkgolides. EGb possess the function of cleaning away heat, preventing and treating blood capillary and hypertension diseases [1]. EGb have been therapeutically used for the stimulation of the central and peripheral blood circulation, reducing blood pressure, improving viscoelasticity of blood, neurological disorders, sclerosis of cerebral arteries, and cerebral ageing [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. So far, HPLC–UV [9, 10], HPLC-photodiode array detection (PDA) [11], capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection (CE–ED) [12] and GC–MS [13, 14, 15] have been used for analysis flavonoids in EGb. Use of HPLC for analysis often has shortcomings such as long analysis time, low resolution, and short column lifetime, owing to easy contamination. GC–MS is not suitable for routine determination in terms of cost, time or complex sample preparation. In the recent years, CE is introduced into the medical analysis for its high separation efficiency, low sample consumption, short analysis time, lower operating cost and relatively simple instrumentation. CE–ED has also been used for this purpose. Electrochemical detector is more sensitive than UV/visible detector and much cheaper than MS detector, however, the problem of interferences caused by electro inactive substances, easy contamination and short life for electrode in electrochemical analysis that restrict its application in Chinese herbs analysis and in vivo biological analysis. As an alternative approach, chemiluminescence (CL) can provide high sensitivity, selectivity and a wide linear dynamic range. The combination of the high separation ability of CE with high sensitivity of CL has become an attractive research brand. To our knowledge, coupling of CE analysis and CL detection has not been applied to analyze the flavonoids of EGb yet. In this paper an efficient and simple method was described to analyze flavonoids in EGb pharmaceuticals and human plasma.
